# Module 20 Assignment: React Portfolio

## Description

This is a React-based portfolio that I created to showcase my work. It includes a header, a navigation bar, a footer, and three pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. The About Me page includes a brief bio and a photo of me. The Portfolio page includes a list of my projects, with links to the deployed applications and the GitHub repositories. The Contact page includes a form that allows users to send me a message. The application is deployed to GitHub Pages.
