        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for designing and
          developing websites and applications that are both aesthetically
          pleasing and functional. I love the challenge of problem-solving and
          building dynamic solutions that improve user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a recent graduate from the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development
          program, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of
          projects, from e-commerce websites to content management systems. My
          expertise lies in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I am also proficient in back-end development and have
          experience working with databases, server-side scripting, and APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from coding, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest web
          development trends and technologies, as well as exploring new tools
          and frameworks. When I'm not working on a project, you can find me
          hiking, keeping up with friends and family, and staying up to date
          with news and current events.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out! I'm
          always excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.
